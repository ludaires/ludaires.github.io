As a former industrial chemist who decided to learn how to code, I wanted to create a project which could combine the two things I love the most: Chemistry and Code. 

A chemical lab has a lot of equipment that needs periodic maintenance: corrective and preventive. I developed an app to help technicians to keep a record of all assets they are responsible for, including scheduling, track maintenance, tasks, and keeping a record of the work they perform.  

The application was built in Ruby, using MVC architecture, and Sinatra as a framework. I used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com "Lucidchart's Homepage") to create a class diagram in the UML  (Unified Modeling Language) to set up beforehand all the classes I would need to make this app simple and functional. 

![Class Diagram](/img/class_diagram.png)

A class diagram is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structures of a system by showing the systemâ€™s classes, their attributes, methods and the relationships among objects.

In the diagram, classes are represented with boxes that contain up to three compartments:
The top compartment contains the name of the class
The middle compartment contains the attributes of the class
The bottom compartment contains the operations the class can execute. 

You can learn more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram "Wikipedia") and how to create a class diagram is this great [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/UI6lqHOVHic "Youtube").
