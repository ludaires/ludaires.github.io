An online student at Flatiron Bootcamp in the Software Engineering program, I was required to do as many labs as possible to test our knowledge about the curriculum. At essential milestones in the curriculum, I was challenged to build applications that became the foundation of our programming portfolio. 

During my time at Flatiron, I had to build five projects: CLI (Command Line Interface) Gem (ruby), Sinatra, Rails, Javascript and, React/Redux.

When looking for a job, during interviews, I had answered many questions. One of these questions was: What was your most challenging project? Thinking about it made me realize my first project was very challenging. Yet, it was not the most difficult. 

The first project is like a white canvas. I did not know what to do. To make this enjoyable, I decided to combine my hobby with coding.
As an anime fan, I decided to rake the best animes of the season.  Unfortunately, I had my first technical issue; the API was in GraphQL, and by that time, I was not comfortable in using it. 

After doing some more research, I decided to use the [Studio Ghibli RESTfull API.](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"}. I had to read a lot, ask questions, interact with the flatiron community at Slack. I had a lot of fun building it, and after that, I realized I could build everything, I felt powerful.  ;)

I believe every challenge, independent of how big it is, can be overcome if I keep learning, iterating with the community, and improving myself.
