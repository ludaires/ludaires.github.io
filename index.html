  <h2>A new life with a new career...</h2>
  <p>
    I was working as a Quality Assurance Manager for a large corporation in Brasil. In 2013, my husband got a very exciting offer to work in New York City. He accepted the offer and we embarked on a journey full of challenges in a new country where everything was fresh and new.</p>
  <p>
    To adapt to a new life, I had to do many things. Learning a new language was number one, understanding the culture and the dynamics of New York City was another.  In the hopes of bettering my English, I started to attend as many meetups, as I could, to practice speaking with new people. During these meetings, I got involved in many technology events and that is where I began learning about coding. Everything I have learned has brought me to a place where I can “communicate" reasonably well in this chaotic environment.  I've been really impressed with how welcoming the tech community is and how much this work has fulfilled my inner desire to continue learning and change my career path to work in technology.</p>
  <p>
    All of these things have encouraged me to pursue my old dream of becoming a software engineer.
  </p>
  <p>Now it is time to buckle down my studies and I am proud to be a student from the Flatiron School in New York City. <br>
  <p>Outside the “Hello, World!” universe, when I'm not busy programming, you can find me riding my bike, drawing, reading or watching some animes!</p>
